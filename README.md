This account is unmodified and plain, it has a3 repositories which arebasically practice but contain nothing else.
I created a repository with a file path and followed with identifying and descripttive content.
I created 2 accounts, one on the server, the other on my local machine. 
I then cloned the repository to my local account and edited the README file for content. Then I pushed the editted file back to the online account.
